		<p><center> In this project, Daramola gave us an Industrial Revolutionary object that we had to research about and how it was used in the past. We also had to create a replicate of the object given to us. For my group, we were given baking powder, so Daramola let us create something that includes baking powder. We created a volcano to see if it will erupt with baking powder and made cookies to show how it creates a reaction when using baking powder.</center></p>
			<p><center>Here is a photo of our volcano and a small diagram of how cookies look with certain amount of baking powder.</p></center>
